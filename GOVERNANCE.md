# Data Software for Social Good Initiative Governance

### Overview
The Data Software for Social Good Initiative brings together and promotes data-centric tools for social good. By creating a vendor-neutral consortium that focuses on building sustainable ecosystems for global good software, this consortium brings together a broad community that enables shared learning and collaboration across projects working to solve some of the world’s toughest and most urgent problems. Data Software for Social Good Initiative comprises open-source “constituent software projects” that the consortium supports and “member organizations” that want to participate in building a community ecosystem to fulfill the consortium’s mission and values. Data Software for Social Good Initiative brings together developers, end users, organizations and vendors to establish and advance common goals. The initiative aims to cooperate and collaborate to create open-standards and open-source software. What being “open” means for your initiative will depend on practical and technical constraints, security and privacy concerns, and the dynamics of the people and networks in your space. The initiative seeks to be flexible similar to the Principles for Digital Development principle: “Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation”.

### Code of conduct
This consortium community aims to be an open and welcoming environment for everyone. All community members must follow the “code of conduct”.

### Roles and responsibilities

#### *Users*
Users are community members who are users of “constituent software projects” or “member organizations software”. They are the most important members of the community and without them the consortium would have no purpose. Anyone can be a user; there are no special requirements.

The consortium asks its users to participate in the consortium and community as much as possible. User contributions enable the consortium’s projects and members to ensure that they are satisfying the needs of those users. User contributions include (but are not limited to):
* evangelizing about the consortium (e.g. a link on a website and word-of-mouth awareness raising)
* informing developers of strengths and weaknesses from a new user perspective
* provide summary reports of success and failures so improvements can be made
* providing moral support (a ‘thank you’ goes a long way)
* providing financial support 
* building community

Users who continue to engage with the consortium and its community will often become more and more involved and will be assigned to working groups. 

The forum is the most appropriate place for a user to ask for help when making their first contribution to the consortium.

#### *Open-Source Constituent Software Projects*
An open-source Constituent Software Project is defined as a software project that has an Open-Source Initiative approved license and is supported by the Data Software for Social Good Initiative’s common resources.  

Data Software for Social Good Initiative does not make decisions for the Constituent Software Projects, but rather focuses on the consortium’s mission and values of enabling collaboration and promoting its open-source Constituent Software Projects. 

The  consortium management committee (CMC) is responsible for determining which projects are accepted into the consortium or removed from the consortium as Constituent Software Projects.

#### *Member Organizations*
A Member Organization is any organization, company, government, or other entity that wants to participate in advancing the consortium's mission and values. These Member Organizations will be featured by the Data Software for Social Good Initiative as Members with common goals.

The Data Software for Social Good Initiative does not make decisions for the Member Organizations, but rather focuses on the consortium’s mission and values of enabling collaboration and promoting its Member Organization and the software solutions provided by the Member Organization. 

The CMC is responsible for determining which organizations are accepted as a member organization into the consortium and removing an organization from consortium if necessary.

#### *Consortium Management Committee*
The consortium management committee (CMC) consists of those individuals identified as ‘organization owners’ of the GitHub organization. 

The CMC Chair is a single individual, elected by the CMC members via a two-third majority vote. The term length for the CMC chair is 1-year. The CMC Chair can resign at any time or be removed by the CMC conducting a removal from chair vote that requires a two-thirds majority vote to pass.

The CMC Chair has no additional authority over other members of the CMC: the role is one of coordinator and facilitator. The Chair is also expected to ensure that all governance processes are adhered to, and has the casting vote when the consortium fails to reach consensus.

##### CMC Membership
The initial CMC membership will be seeded by existing members of Open Data Kit Transitional Project Management Committees on  [[date the motion passes]]; however, the initial term length will only be 14 days while the ”constituent software projects” or the “member organizations” elect their representatives.

The CMC is made up of a representative from each ”constituent software projects” and “member organizations”. Each ”constituent software project” and “member organization” chooses their representative independently through their own governance process.

CMC members are expected to regularly participate in CMC activities. Members who have not consistently taken meaningful actions as CMC members in the past 6 months will be considered for removal. Examples of meaningful actions are participating regularly in calls, providing technical mentorship, working on community building, obtaining funding, leading working groups, etc. Once a member is removed the ”constituent software projects” or “member organizations” is responsible for choosing the replacement CMC member.

##### CMC Meetings
The CMC will meet regularly (generally every once a month). The meeting will be run by the CMC Chair and each meeting will be conducted and published to a publicly accessible platform (e.g., UberConference). Meeting frequency, times, agenda, and notes will also be published to a publicly accessible platform (e.g., the forum, Google Docs).

The CMC will default to working in public, but sensitive topics (e.g., pre-disclosure security problems, confidential pre-agreement discussions with third parties, personal conflicts among personnel) should only be discussed on private channels.

An item can be added to the agenda by a community member by adding a cmc-agenda tag to the GitHub issue or forum post.

Prior to each CMC meeting, the moderator will share the agenda with members of the CMC. CMC members can add any items they like to the agenda at the beginning of each meeting. If too many items are added to the agenda to reasonably be discussed in the time allocated for the meeting, CMC members can vote to table an agenda item to the next meeting. The moderator and the CMC cannot veto or remove items.

The CMC may invite non-members to participate in a non-voting capacity. These invitees will be listed on the agenda.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each agenda item and publishing it on a publicly accessible platform (e.g., the forum). 

### Decision making process
Decisions about the future of the consortium are made through discussion with all members of the community, from the newest user to the most experienced CMC member. All non-sensitive consortium management discussion takes place on consortium discussion forums. Occasionally, sensitive discussion occurs on a private list.
* Decision making typically involves the following steps:
* Proposal
* Discussion
* Vote 
* Decision

Any community member can make a proposal for consideration by the community. In order to initiate a discussion about a new idea, they should post on the forum, or submit a patch implementing the idea to the issue trackers. This will prompt a review and, if necessary, a discussion of the idea. The goal of this review and discussion is to gain approval for the contribution. Since most people in the consortium community have a shared vision, there is often little need for discussion in order to reach consensus. A CMC member must respond to the proposal that it is fine to proceed or it needs a vote by the community or vote by the CMC.

#### *Community Voting*
Some decisions should be made by the broader community of active consortium users instead of the CMC.  To start a formal vote of the community a CMC member should post on the details of the decision to forum with ‘[VOTE]’ in the title/subject line. The CMC member should choose the appropriate voting. To vote community members send a post in reply to the original ‘[VOTE]’ post, with the following vote and information:
* +1 ‘yes’, ‘agree’: also willing to help bring about the proposed action
* +0 ‘yes’, ‘agree’: not willing or able to help bring about the proposed action
* -0 ‘no’, ‘disagree’: but will not oppose the action’s going forward
* -1 ‘no’, ‘disagree’: opposes the action’s going forward and must propose an alternative action to address the issue (or a justification for not addressing the issue)
* ‘Veto’: which means the CMC member rejects the voting method as the member believes that the issue is such an important one that it requires CMC to make the decision instead of the larger community.

When a [VOTE] receives a ‘-1’, it is the responsibility of the community as a whole to address the objection. Such discussion will continue until the objection is either rescinded, overruled (in the case of a non-binding veto) or the proposal itself is altered in order to achieve consensus (possibly by withdrawing it altogether). 

In summary:
* Those who don’t agree with the proposal and think they have a better idea should vote -1 and defend their counter-proposal.
* Those who don’t agree but don’t have a better idea should vote -0.
* Those who agree but will not actively assist in implementing the proposal should vote +0.
* Those who agree and will actively assist in implementing the proposal should vote +1.

#### *Types of approval*
Different actions require different types of approval, ranging from lazy majority to a 2/3 decision by the CMC. These are summarised in the table below. The section after the table describes which type of approval should be used in common situations.

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Description</th>
            <th>Duration</th>

    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Lazy majority</td>
            <td>A lazy majority vote requires more binding +1 votes than
            binding -1 votes.</td>
            <td>72 hours</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Consensus approval</td>
            <td>Consensus approval requires three binding +1 votes and no

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Unanimous consensus</td>
            <td>All of the binding votes that are cast are to be +1 and
            there can be no binding vetoes (-1).</td>
            <td>120 hours</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2/3 majority</td>
            <td>Some strategic actions require a 2/3 majority of PMC
            members; in addition, 2/3 of the binding votes cast must be
            +1. Such actions typically affect the foundation of the
            project (e.g. adopting a new codebase to replace an existing
            product).</td>
            <td>120 hours</td>
